**Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a fraud detection system for an international bank that processes millions of transactions daily. By analyzing historical transaction data, the system identifies potential instances of fraud, protecting both the bank and its customers from financial losses.

Features
Anomaly Detection: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual transaction patterns.
Real-Time Monitoring: Capable of flagging suspicious transactions in real-time for further investigation.
Detailed Reporting: Generates comprehensive reports on detected anomalies and their characteristics.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
Installation
To set up the fraud detection system, follow these steps:


**Copy code**
python main.py
View Results: The results will be saved in the results/ directory, including flagged transactions and summary reports.
Data Sources
The dataset used for this project consists of five years of transactional data provided by the international bank. It includes features such as transaction ID, date, amount, transaction type, customer ID, and location.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis)
Model Evaluation
The model will be evaluated based on metrics such as:
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
ROC-AUC
Continuous monitoring and retraining will be conducted to ensure effectiveness as new data comes in.
